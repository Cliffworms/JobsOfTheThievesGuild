===============
1. DESCRIPTION
===============

Jobs of the Thieves Guild adds 12 new quests that can be taken from the guildmaster.
Those quests explore other avenues of the underworld such as loan sharks, prostitution,
protection money and conflicts with a rival criminal organization.

Indeed, it brings back the Wharf Rats from Arena, who were the Thieves Guild's rivals.
They will sometimes be the enemy in some of the quests' scenarios. 

Most quests have more than one scenario so that they do not always play the same way.

Find out why a shopkeeper stopped paying for protection, recover gold from an indebted citizen,
hire a wizard for the guild's protection, accompany a group of thieves in an hostage exchange
with the Wharf Rats, and more.

I hope you had as much fun as I had creating these quests. 

Shadow guide you.
