QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>            One of Ma'am %ln's girls informed us
<ce>            a noble is about to move a valuable
<ce>            stone to a friend. Got some free time
<ce>            ahead of you to track the noble’s
<ce>            courier and get the gem?
<--->
<ce>            A noble we’ve been spying on for some
<ce>            time likes to send jewels to a contact
<ce>            using adventurers as couriers. I want
<ce>            that gem and I don’t care about the
<ce>            courier’s fate. You in?
<--->
<ce>            Most nobles like us, but there’s one
<ce>            bastard who doesn’t. We got a tip that
<ce>            the fool will move a gem for
<ce>            safekeeping. That stone must not get
<ce>            to its destination. That interests you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            Yeah, I figured you weren’t the hunting
<ce>            type. Your loss. Those _reward_ gold pieces
<ce>            will go to someone competent enough.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            So, we know that _noble_’s about to
<ce>            send a courier carrying a _gem_, but we don’t
<ce>            know exactly when. Our spymaster’s on that case.
<ce>            Your job, for now, is to wait for his letter
<ce>            detailing the courier’s expected voyage. Once
<ce>            you receive it, track that courier and grab the
<ce>            jewel. Normally we condone killing, but we’ve
<ce>            received the higher ups’ approbation if it's
<ce>            necessary. Good hunting. 
<--->
<ce>            That’s what I like to hear. We don’t know where
<ce>            _noble_’s courier is at the moment,
<ce>            so wait for a letter from our spymaster. I suggest
<ce>            you stay in town until you receive it. Then, track
<ce>            that bastard down and get me that _gem_. This
<ce>            time, violence is tolerated if it's self-defense.
<ce>            Have fun, %lev.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            Yup, that looks like the _gem_ alright. Good
<ce>            show snatching it from that adventurer. When
<ce>            will they ever learn that doing honest
<ce>            deliveries is not a profitable venture? Here’s
<ce>            yer pay.

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
_noble_ is still in the smuggling business, I hear.
<--->
There's been an extraordinary increase in smuggling lately.

RumorsPostFailure:   [1006]
No one knows who the kingpin is behind the _contraband_ smuggling."

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
I hear _noble_ is mad as hell at some adventurer %g hired as a courier. I guess the package was lost or stolen.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Ah, _noble_’s bane. How may I help you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Remember the _gem_, %lev? The one you didn't snatch from that adventurer? %oth, %pcf, that stone was worth a fortune. Get out of here.

I’m on a job from _questgiver_ of the
Thieves Guild in ___questgiver_ to intercept a
_gem_ sent from some noble known as _noble_.
I must wait a few days for the spymaster’s letter
that will detail the courier’s schedule. Killing
the courier will be tolerated if it's self-defense.

Message: 1015
%qdt
I received the spymaster’s letter. The courier,
some =dummy_ named _dummy_,
departs from __depart_'s
palace and is supposed to arrive in __dest_
in =timer_ days. __dest_ is a small town,
so %g should be easy to spot on the streets.

Message: 1020
<ce>
%pcf, the courier's some
=dummy_ adventurer
called _dummy_.
<ce>
My contact at __depart_'s palace says
%g should make it to some shanty town
called __dest_ in =timer_ days.
So get there as soon as you can and
walk the town's streets. 
<ce>
If the fool's delayed, I'll let you know.
<ce>
<ce>Good hunting.

Message: 1025
<ce>        A well-dressed man walks past you, handing
<ce>        you a piece of paper while casually
<ce>        continuing his walk.
<--->
<ce>        A well-dressed woman walks past you,
<ce>        handing you a piece of paper while
<ce>        casually continuing her walk.
<--->
<ce>        A child walks past you, handing you a piece
<ce>        of paper before running away.

Message: 1030
<ce>        You see a =dummy_ walking __dest_'s
<ce>        streets in the opposite direction. _dummy_,
<ce>        oblivious of your presence, walks closer to you.
<ce>
<ce>        "The Thieves Guild has word that you are carrying
<ce>        a gemstone of considerable value. Hand it over
<ce>        and I'll let you off easy." you say to the courier.
<ce>
<ce>        _dummy_’s surprise quickly turns to
<ce>        terror. The courier fetches %g3 travel bag and
<ce>        quickly hands you the _gem_.
<ce>
<ce>        "Like taking coin from a child. Now, get out of
<ce>        my sight, you weak-kneed courier.” you tell
<ce>        _dummy_ who, following your clear
<ce>        instructions, flees through a nearby alley.

Message: 1040
<ce>        You see a =dummy_ walking __dest_'s

<ce>        and I'll let you off easy." you say to the courier.
<ce>
<ce>        _dummy_’s surprise is brief as %g
<ce>        unsheathes %g3 weapon. Defiant, %g
<ce>        answers back :
<ce>
<ce> 
<ce>        "You want the _gem_, thief? Come and get it, fool!"

Message: 1050
<ce>        You have not arrived on time in __dest_
<ce>        to intercept the courier. By now, _dummy_ must
<ce>        have succesfully completed %g3 delivery.

Message: 1060
<ce>        You look behind you and notice _dummy_
<ce>        is no longer there. The adventurer must have
<ce>        used this opportunity to run to %g3 contact
<ce>        to deliver the package. Who that contact is,
<ce>        you will never know.

Message: 1070
<ce>        _dummy_ collapses before you, now
<ce>        lifeless. You see a gem falling off %g3 pocket. 
<ce>        Taking a closer look, it is indeed the _gem_
<ce>        you've been tasked to retrieve.
