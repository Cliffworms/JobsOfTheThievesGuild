<ce>            A merchant we protect owes us some
<ce>            serious coin and the fool has decided
<ce>            not to pay. I want you to remind that
<ce>            deadbeat what protection money is.
<--->
<ce>            You know our ways, %lev. When we
<ce>            protect a merchant, he sends us money.
<ce>            When we receive the money, we ensure
<ce>            no harm comes to his shop. But when
<ce>            that merchant decides to stop sending
<ce>            the gold, we remind him who truly owns
<ce>            his store. Care to teach one of those
<ce>            merchants a lesson?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            So beating up somebody is not your style,
<ce>            %lev? Fine. Talk to me later and
<ce>            I might have a burglary job.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            Good. Get to _shop_ and speak to
<ce>            the owner, _dummy_. Not the fool
<ce>            %g employs to deal with customers. If
<ce>            _dummy_ is stubborn, break something valuable
<ce>            from %g3 store. I’m sure there’s one such
<ce>            item lying around somewhere. A word of warning 
<ce>            though, I don’t want %g2 killed. Bad for
<ce>            business. See you in =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>            

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>    Here, take your pay. See ya.


RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
Someone I know who shopped at  _shop_ told me the owner seemed stressed and nervous. 

RumorsPostFailure:   [1006]
There’s been a violent burglary at _shop_, I heard. The owner, _dummy_ was found unconscious and numerous wares were stolen. It’s horrible!

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
I feel safe shopping at _shop_. _dummy_ recently hired guards to make sure no thief steals his wares.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Terrible weather outside. Oh, screw that small talk. %lev, you may be interested to know that our dear shopkeeper is now paying us in time. Thanks to you.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Ye remember the shopkeeper ye had to shake down for our protection money? Well since ye failed, we hired some muscles to rough him up and mess up his store. Ye know what? He actually pays on time now. No thanks to you.

I’m on a job from the Thieves Guild in
___questgiver_ to remind
_dummy_, owner of
_shop_ here in town, how
important it is to pay for protection
on time. The guild hasn't received the
last payment and the the guildmaster's
impatient. If I can’t convince
_dummy_ with words,
maybe breaking something valuable from
the store will work. I have =timer_ days
to get this done.

Message: 1020
<ce>    You’re from those thugs? Well I’ve had
<ce>    enough of your intimidation. Your guild’s
<ce>    protection brings me no benefit. In fact,
<ce>    I’ve been stolen from last week! So, no.
<ce>    Tell your good-for-nothing mecreants I’ll
<ce>    call the guards if they send another
<ce>    lackey again. Scram!

Message: 1021
<ce>    This _object_ looks valuable. Breaking
<ce>    it may convince _dummy_ to
<ce>    change %g3 mind.
<ce>
<ce>    Before _dummy_ can react, you pick
<ce>    the gem and smash it on the wall with all
<ce>    your strength, shattering it to pieces
<ce>    before %g3 alarmed eyes. The _object_
<ce>    looks indeed to be beyond repair.
<ce>
<ce>
<ce>    "No! That was priceless! All right! I get
<ce>    it. I’ll pay on time from now on. Just 
<ce>    don’t smash anything else. And get out of
<ce>    here!"

Message: 1028
<ce>    I surrender! Stop! You will get the gold in
<ce>    time from now on! Just, don't hurt me anymore.
<ce>    I'm sorry!

Message: 1030
<ce>    Wha… what? Oh, it’s one of you people. So,
<ce>    your boss doesn’t even bother to show up
<ce>    anymore, eh? Well, petty threats and fist
<ce>    waving are not going to sway me. You people
<ce>    are all talk, and everyone knows it! Pay
<ce>    you to protect me? You can’t even protect
<ce>    yourselves! Here, let me introduce you to
<ce>    my personal guard. 
<ce>
<ce>    %nam, show this damn %ra I won’t
<ce>    have any business with the Thieves Guild, 
<ce>    will you?

Message: 1035
<ce>    Okay, okay! Oh, my. Tell your boss I’ll be
<ce>    paying from now on, okay? Just, don’t hurt 
<ce>    me. Please. I… I need to clean that mess
<ce>    before a customer arrives. 

Message: 1040
<ce>    Protection money? Please! Please! It’s not
<ce>    my fault. It’s the Wharf Rats! They came in
<ce>    some days ago, broke my nose and made a
<ce>    mess of the place, saying they owned the
<ce>    store now. They said they’d burn my shop if
<ce>    I informed you!

Message: 1045
<ce>    _dummy_ leaves in a hurry as
<ce>    two bandits leave their hiding spot, grinning.
<ce>    One of them says :
<ce>
<ce>
<ce>    "_shop_ is property of the Wharf Rats
<ce>    now, lackey. When we're done with you, we’ll send 
<ce>    your severed head to your boss with our personal
<ce>    greetings strapped to your lips. Get that %ra!"

Message: 1048
<ce>    The lone remaining Wharf Rat, startled by the turn
<ce>    of events, turns tail and runs out of _shop_.

Message: 1060
<ce>    There’s always one who thinks he can outsmart us
<ce>    and get away with paying us, right %lev? 

Message: 1063
<ce>    So we lost _shop_ to those damn Wharf Rats?
<ce>    %oth, those dung-eating sons of whores will get what’s
<ce>    coming to them, mark my words. And we’ll need more 
<ce>    gold to increase the safety of our places. So, I can’t
<ce>    spare any coin for your job, %lev. I bet we’ll have an
<ce>    opportunity to hit ‘em where it hurts, don’t worry.

Message: 1065
<ce>    The damn Wharf Rats tried to take over _shop_,
<ce>    you say? %oth, you dealt them a terrible blow by
<ce>    killing their boys. That’s what I call a perfect job. You other
<ce>    lackeys better take notes of what %pcf did here today.
<ce>    For saving our shop and sending those dung-eating sons of whores
<ce>    to Arkay, take this _magicitem_ as a bonus.
<ce>    With my utmost appreciation.

Message: 1068
<ce>    What in Oblivion you mean _dummy_'s dead!?
<ce>    Didn't I make myself clear, %lev!? %oth!
<ce>    %oth! What good are your ears if ye can't use 'em?
<ce>    Get out of my sight!
