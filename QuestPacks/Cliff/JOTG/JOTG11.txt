<ce>            %lev, can ye spare an hour or two? Yesterday
<ce>            I sent someone to rob a house in town and he hasn’t
<ce>            come back. I hope nothing bad happened.
<--->
<ce>            %pcf, one of our thieves hasn’t returned from
<ce>            a burglary and I fear something bad may have happened.
<ce>            Can ye go check?
<--->
<ce>            %oth! Am I surrounded by idiots in this guild!?
<ce>            %pcf, we have a dumb-headed of a thief who hasn’t returned
<ce>            from a robbery. An important rule of burglary is to always
<ce>            report once the job’s done. Can ye go check it out?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            Seriously %pcf? If you don’t return from a job
<ce>            I gave ya, I won’t send help yer way.
<--->
<ce>            That’s a shame, %lev. A damn shame.
<ce>            Get out of here.

<ce>            So. _dummy_ went to break into _location_.
<ce>            If %g messed up, I want you to clean up the place so it
<ce>            can’t be traced back to us. If %g’s not there, I want
<ce>            you to to find %g2. All clear? You’d better make it quick
<ce>            before the guards send someone of their own to investigate.
<ce>            Get that done today, okay?
<--->
<ce>            The fool’s name is _dummy_ and I ordered %g2 to rob
<ce>            _location_ blind. Either things didn’t go %g3 way or %g
<ce>            messed up and ran away. Or maybe something worse. If there’s
<ce>            a mess, clean it up. If _dummy_ isn’t there, find %g2. All
<ce>            clear? Get that done today. I don't want the guards to
<ce>            investigate the place.

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
I hear there’s been more break-ins in town lately. Get yourself a weapon and lock your doors at night.

RumorsPostFailure:   [1006]
There’s been lots of guards at _location_. Some burglary gone bad, from what I hear.
<--->
Some ruffians killed poor %mn2 inside his own house. This is horrible, I tell you.
<--->
Some ruffians killed poor %fn2 inside her own house. This is horrible, I tell you.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
%nam’s been missing for the last few days. Some fear the worst.
<--->
%fn2’s husband is worried. He arrived at his home only to find no traces of his wife. No goodbye letter. Nothing.
<--->
%mn2’s wife is worried. She arrived at her home only find no traces of her husband. No goodbye letter. Nothing.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Hey there. Still no word from the city guards about that robbery gone bad at _location_. What can I do ye for?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
You know, I still need to bribe some officials from time to time about that horrible job you did at _location_. So make it quick. I ain’t happy about you.

I've been ordered by _questgiver_ of the
Thieves Guild in ___questgiver_ to find
the whereabouts of _dummy_,
a fellow thief that was sent to rob
_location_. If something bad
happened, I am to clean the place so that
the city guards do not link the burglary
to the Thieves Guild. I need to do this
today.

Message: 1011
%qdt
_dummy_ escaped _location_ after
killing the owner. I need to bring the owner's
corpse to ___cemetary_ where a contact
of the Thieves Guild will dispose of it. In the
meantime, the guildmaster will have his spymaster
find the location of _dummy_.

Message: 1012
%qdt
_dummy_'s hiding in _res_.
The guildmaster prefers to have %g2 alive.

<ce>            As you close the door behind you, someone arrives
<ce>            from a nearby room, nervous.
<ce>
<ce>            “You from the Guild too? I live nearby and heard
<ce>            the commotion. The thief who broke into the place
<ce>            got in a fight with the owner. There’s a corpse
<ce>            in one of the rooms. What a damn mess. I’ll keep
<ce>            a lookout for the guards while you investigate,
<ce>            okay?”
<ce>
<ce>            The thief returns to another room, keeping watch.

<ce>            Someone stands before you in the hall.
<ce>
<ce>            “What a mess. What a damn mess! Ye must be the
<ce>            one from the Guild to clean that I guess? Our
<ce>            guildmate who broke in here killed the owner
<ce>            before fleeing the place. Tell you what, you do
<ce>            your things and I warn ye if I see any guards
<ce>            coming our way.”

<ce>            Judging by the corpse’s attire, it is obvious it

<ce>            Speaking of expelling, that dumb thief of ours
<ce>            is hiding at _res_. The fool believes %g’s
<ce>            safe. Get there, knock out %g3 teeth and get back
<ce>            with %g2. If _dummy_ dies on the way, I’d
<ce>            need to send you back to that graveyard. I don’t
<ce>            want that. You don’t want that. Now go. Not you,

<ce>            Stop! Wait! Look, what happened at _location_ isn’t
<ce>            my fault! The owner attacked me and I had no choice but to
<ce>            defend myself! I was told the house was empty. Come on.
<ce>            You make mistakes too, don’t you? Look, I’ll run away from
<ce>            %reg and the Guild won’t ever see me again. Tell
<ce>            _questgiver_ I’m gone. Honor between thieves,
<ce>            right?

Message: 1111
<ce>            Thanks, %ra. I'll gather my things and leave %cn
<ce>            as soon as I can.

Message: 1112
<ce>            %oth, %ra. Okay. Maybe it's better I face _questgiver_
<ce>            and explain myself.

Message: 1115
<ce>            I’m warning you, %ra. That death was not accidental
<ce>            at all. I’m tired of the damn Thieves Guild. The
<ce>            owner at _location_ was my target so I could
<ce>            be initiated in the Dark Brotherhood. Is that
<ce>            sending chills in your bones, lackey? Leave my
<ce>            house now or I will send your soul to Sithis.

Message: 1210
<ce>            “You... you’re not _friend_. I… I

<ce>
<ce>            The man’s eyes show fear as he stares at

<ce>
<ce>            “No! Please! Don’t kill me, please! Your

Message: 1211
<ce>            Defenseless, disposing of _dummy_’s

Message: 1212
<ce>            The front door opens. The visitor, a burly

<ce>
<ce>            “%mn2! Die, %ra! DIE!” screams

Message: 1213

Message: 1400
<ce>            So that _dummy_’s gone from %reg. I guess we
<ce>            should have acted sooner, but %g’s the fool. Not us. We
<ce>            have eyes all over the Iliac Bay.. I’m sure we’ll hear
<ce>            from one of our other guild halls soon enough. Thank you
<ce>            for clearing that mess, %lev. Much appreciated.

Message: 1401
<ce>            _dummy_, ye goddamn dummy! Yer botched up
<ce>            burglary almost got the guards here, ye know that?
<ce>            Consider yerself expelled. Yeah that’s right.
<ce>            That kind of mistake can be only tolerated once.
<ce>            It was good that %pcf was here to get us out
<ce>            of this mess and to get yer sorry arse back here.
<ce>            %pcf, good work. Take yer pay and leave us
<ce>            please. We ain’t done with _dummy_ yet. Hehe.

Message: 1402
<ce>            %oth. I wished _dummy_ alive so we could teach
<ce>            %g2 a manner or two before expelling %g3 sorry hide from
<ce>            here. Ye did good on that job, %pcf. Disposing
<ce>            of that body and killin’ _dummy_ brings us full
<ce>            circle, I think. Nobody will trace that back to us.

Message: 1403
<ce>            _dummy_, an assassin!? %oth, that takes things
<ce>            to another level. We don’t want problems with the Dark
<ce>            Brotherhood. As much as I would love to see %g2 dead,
<ce>            I think you did the right thing to let %g2 live. Out
<ce>            of sight, out of mind. Right, %pcf? You certainly
<ce>            earned your pay for cleaning up that damn mess for us.

Message: 1404
<ce>            %oth, _dummy_’s with the Dark Brotherhood
<ce>            and ye killed %g2!? %oth! Oh, right. Damn bastard’s
<ce>            only an initiate so I doubt they’ll cry over %g3 death.
<ce>            I think you did the right thing, killing that fool and
<ce>            cleaning up %g3 mess.

Message: 1500
<ce>            %oth, that’s _dummy_ alright. Damn it!
<ce>            Was the owner still there? What did you do?
<ce>            Avenge _dummy_?

Message: 1501
<ce>            Good. I’m not a vengeance kind of fellow, but
<ce>            _dummy_ was well respected around here.
<ce>            It’ll put some of us at ease to know %g3 killer’s gone.
<ce>            Leave %g3 to me, %lev. I’ll get a priest of Arkay and
<ce>            hold a proper funeral. 
<--->
<ce>            %oth! Are you trying to get the Dark
<ce>            Brotherhood’s attention? You did good bringing
<ce>            _dummy_ here, but avenging %g2… that wasn’t wise.
<ce>            Anyway, I doubt they’ll trace that back to us.
<ce>            Let’s hope so.

Message: 1502
<ce>            That’s a shame. _dummy_ was loved around
<ce>            the hall here. Leave %g3 body here. I’ll send
<ce>            for a priest of Arkay and get %g3 proper
<ce>            funeral rites.
<--->
<ce>            Then you did the right thing, %lev.
<ce>            We wouldn’t want to attract more attention.
<ce>            Leave _dummy_’s body here. I’ll send
<ce>            for a priest of Arkay. Poor fellow…
<ce>            %g was well liked around here.	

Message: 1600
<ce>            You had one day to check out on _dummy_'s
<ce>            status. Either %g's alive or not. You may never know.
