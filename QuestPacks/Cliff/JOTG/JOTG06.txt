<ce>            I got a job for you. Something that might
<ce>            add some clink to your pockets. I’ve heard
<ce>            that one of the Mages Guild will be empty
<ce>            for several nights. Interested?
<--->
<ce>            We got a tip, %lev. One of %crn's
<ce>            Mages Guild will be unguarded for many nights. 
<ce>            The wizards are apparently meeting outside for
<ce>            an experiment, ritual or whatever it is they
<ce>            do. Anyway, that means the place is unguarded
<ce>            and ripe for the picking. What do you say?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            %oth. If you ain’t gonna do a simple
<ce>            and quick job like this, how do you expect to 
<ce>            rise in the ranks, %pcn?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            Good %ra. So like I said, get to the Mages
<ce>            Guild in __guild_ and try to find
<ce>            something magical that could be of interest. I’m
<ce>            sure you’ll find something. I hear the mages are
<ce>            away from midnight to late in the morning, so
<ce>            that'd be the the best time to break in the place.
<ce>            Those rituals of theirs are supposed to end in
<ce>            around =timer_ days, so keep that in mind.

<ce>            Say, that looks valuable. Good show, %lev.
<ce>            I’ll have that identified and sold to the highest bidder.
<ce>            Oh, yeah. Sorry if you ran into trouble. Seems like the
<ce>            Mages Guild always knows when we’re planning something.
<ce>            Here’s your gold.

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
There were strange lights outside last night. Probably the Mages Guild practicing their spells.

RumorsPostFailure:   [1006]
I hear there’s been a failed burglary at one of the Mages Guild halls. Their guardian bravely repulsed the thief.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
Burglars are getting reckless by the day. Everyone's talking about the break-in at the Mages Guild.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
The Mages Guild burglar in person. We made good profit from your job. What do you need?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
We missed a damn good opportunity to rob the Mages Guild because of your incompetence. Don’t think I’ll forget that anytime soon.

Guild is sending me to the __guild_ Mages Guild.
Apparently, the place is empty from midnight to late in
the morning for the next =timer_ days, so any magical
trinket is free for the taking while the mages are out.
This is the only opportunity we have to break inside their
hall.

<ce>                You suddenly shiver as a cold wind
<ce>                from down the hall strokes your hair...

Message: 1022
<ce>                The air suddenly grows much warmer,
<ce>                as if a fire had started down the hall...

Message: 1024
<ce>                You are suddenly startled as you hear
<ce>                heavy, metallic footsteps from down
<ce>                the hall breaking the Mages Guild silence...

Message: 1026
<ce>                You are suddenly startled as you hear light
<ce>                footsteps, almost sounding like bare feet,
<ce>                from down the hall, breaking the Mages
<ce>                Guild silence...

Message: 1030
<ce>                A wizard turns the corner and notices you
<ce>                with the magical item in your hands.
<ce>
<ce>                "Colleagues! A thief is escaping with our
<ce>                _trinket_! Call the guards!"

Message: 1040
<ce>                An atronach guarding the magical item, you
<ce>                say? Seems like the Mages Guild always knows 
<ce>                when we’re planning something. Killing one
<ce>                of those things is rarely heard in the guild, 
<ce>                so how about I double your reward? Can’t say
<ce>                no to that, can you? Nice work.

Message: 1041
<ce>                This _trinket_ beams with magical energy.
