<ce>            %lev, one of ours has brought back a
<ce>            chest stolen from some wizard. Thing is, even
<ce>            our best locksmith can’t unlock it and we need
<ce>            it opened today. You wouldn’t happen to know
<ce>            the Open spell, wouldn’t you?
<--->
<ce>            I don’t have a major job for ye, %lev.
<ce>            Just a simple task if yer free today and know
<ce>            yer way around magic to cast the Open spell.
<ce>            We have some hot property here that’s been 
<ce>            magically locked. Can ye lend us a hand for a
<ce>            minute?
<--->
<ce>            Last week we got a contract to steal a mage’s
<ce>            box. One of our boys snatched it while the
<ce>            wizard was busy reading.  Anyway, we can’t
<ce>            unlock it. Seems like it’s been locked with a
<ce>            spell. Our friend in the Mages Guild isn’t
<ce>            available, our contact wants its contents
<ce>            today and nobody here knows the Open spell. 
<ce>            Do you know such magic?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            Damn it! Run along now.
<--->
<ce>            I took you for the spellcasting type. I was
<ce>            wrong. See ya later.
<--->
<ce>            %oth. I’m supposed to meet a
<ce>            spellsword later anyway. I guess I’ll pay
<ce>            him to open it. See ya.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            Alright. Here’s the chest. Like I said, I
<ce>            need it unlocked today. 
<--->
<ce>            Hey boys, fetch me that wizard’s chest.
<ce>            Our %ra %lev here will open it.
<ce>            Get that opened today, will you? 
<--->
<ce>            Good, here it is. Now make it quick. Our
<ce>            contact is coming later today and will
<ce>            want it unlocked on arrival.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>            So, have you managed to open that casket yet?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            What a waste of time and efforts. Damn
<ce>            wizards. We paid a mighty good price
<ce>            for a tip on that crap. Anyway, I
<ce>            appreciate yer help. Here, take the
<ce>            standard guild fee.

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
There was a bolt of lightning in the sky yesterday. I guess the town’s wizard’s angry about something.

RumorsPostFailure:   [1006]
A mage here in town keeps asking for a lost casket of his. He seemed furious.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
Don’t tell anyone I told you this, but apparently the Thieves Guild is behind a theft at some mage’s house.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Hey, %lev. Our favorite thief who knows magic! Remember that useless box ya opened for us?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
For shadows’ sake, the hell ya want? I’m still angry at ye for failing to open that stupid wizard’s box.

Thieves Guild has asked me to open some casket stolen
from a wizard with standard Open spell. The Guild
needs it opened today before our contact arrives to
take its contents.

<ce>                  As you cast Open on the chest, the
<ce>                 lid springs open and an imp flies out.
<ce>                                    
<ce>                "Happy birthday, %nam you old fart!"
<ce>                   the imp cackles in an unnaturally
<ce>                          deep gravelly voice.

Message:  1030
<ce>                  You hear the lock click as you cast
<ce>                  Open on the chest.  Inside is a wand
<ce>                  inscribed: "To %nam on your 110th
<ce>                   birthday.  Use me for a preview of
<ce>                         your 120th birthday!"

<ce>                Smoke pours from the chest as you cast
<ce>               Open on it.  The lid pops open, revealing
<ce>                           an engraved card:
<ce>                                    
 Dear %nam,
 
 Hope you like the new place.  Did
 you remember to call the exterminator
 before you moved in?
 
 Your friend,
 
 %fn2

Message:  1050
<ce>                    The lid of the chest pops open.
<ce>                      Inside is nothing but a few
<ce>                       scraps of faded confetti.
