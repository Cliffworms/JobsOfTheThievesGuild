<ce>            Our spymaster got wind of documents that
<ce>            may, how should I put it,  "convince" a
<ce>            lord to overlook our activities in his
<ce>            city. So, ye think ye have what it takes
<ce>            to get those papers from a well-guarded
<ce>            palace?
                                     <--->
<ce>            One of our assistants is well paid to
<ce>            forge official documents. Turns out a
<ce>            lord’s about to publish a proclamation
<ce>            that may benefit us. I want ye to get
<ce>            in that lord’s palace and steal it so
<ce>            we can have it forged to our own
<ce>            benefit. 
                                     <--->
<ce>            Word on the street is that some lord
<ce>            likes to write pardon edicts to erase 
<ce>            his noble friends' less than favorable
<ce>            deeds. I say we get one of those and
<ce>            have it forged in case one of ours
<ce>            gets caught. Care to help? 

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            Didn’t think you’d skip this one, %lev.
<ce>            'Tis an opportunity to show yer good and ye
<ce>            let it go. Another one will get his
<ce>            promotion then, not you. 

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            Alright. The palace we heard about is the one
<ce>            in __palace_. I guess I shouldn't have
<ce>            to tell you to break into the place at night
<ce>            when the place is empty, right? Anyway, it
<ce>            shouldn’t take you more than =timer_ days to
<ce>            get there, grab the stuff and be back. I want
<ce>            that job to be discreet and fast. No killin’,
<ce>            or those documents will be useless. Is that
<ce>            clear %lev? I’m sure it is.
                                     <--->
<ce>            Good. Get your sorry hide to the palace in
<ce>            __palace_. Make sure you break into the place
<ce>            at night. I don't think the lord would want to
<ce>            catch you snooping around the place while court
<ce>            is in session. Once you grab the document, get
<ce>            back here and I'll have it forged. See you in
<ce>            =timer_ days, %lev.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>            What's the matter, %lev? Afraid of breaking
<ce>            into a palace?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            That’ll help the guild for sure. Now it’s our
<ce>            forger’s turn to help put those documents to
<ce>            good use. As for ye, here’s yer standard guild
<ce>            fee. See you around, %lev.

RumorsDuringQuest:   [1005]
They say that close friends of __palace_’s lord can get pardoned for their crimes.
<--->
A noble from __palace_ got away with murder! This is preposterous!
<--->
I heard that nobles who are good friends with __palace_’s lord can get away with tax evasion. 

RumorsPostFailure:   [1006]
Street gangs went crazy when they heard the lord of __palace_ kept pardon edicts in the palace.
<--->
The town crier of __palace_ declared that all pardon edicts are forfeit. 
<--->
Apparently a thief got caught red-handed trying to snatch a pardon edict from __palace_’s palace.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
It’s strange. The jails in __palace_ are emptier than usual. 
<--->
There have been less public executions in __palace_ of late. Where could these criminals be?
<--->
A pickpocket who had been caught robbing a noble in __palace_ was pardoned! Can you imagine?

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Thanks to you, we’ve been able to free several of our jailed boys and girls. How can I help you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
One of our best thieves will need to serve five more years because we couldn’t get a pardon edict. You’d best make up for your failure.

<ce>            As you pick up the document, a knight turns
<ce>            the corner and sees you. 
<ce>
<ce>            "Thief! Stop right there!" he shouts as he
<ce>            rushes towards you. You hear more sounds of
<ce>            heavy boots coming your way...

Message: 1025
<ce>            A guard on patrol turns the corner and sees
<ce>            you.
<ce>
<ce>            "Halt! Stop right there, criminal scum!"

_questgiver_ sent me to steal a pardon
edict from the palace in __palace_.
I have been specifically instructed not
to kill anyone. I must return with the
document at the Thieves Guild in
___questgiver_ in =timer_ days or less.

Message: 1040
<ce>            That edict’s useless, %lev. Why? Because
<ce>            everyone’s talkin’ about how some fellow
<ce>            was butchered by a %ra thief who
<ce>            ran away with the document. The lord’s
<ce>            most likely aware that the edict was the
<ce>            target and he’ll make sure it’s useless
<ce>            to us now. What a botched job. Get out
<ce>            of here.
